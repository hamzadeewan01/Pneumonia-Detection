## Pneumonia-Detection
We have built an app that helps to detect and classify human diseases (here, pneumonia) from medical images. 
We have created a detection model using a convolutional neural network in python.

### Tech/Framework Used
We have created the android app in the Android Studio that includes java and XML and the model is created using python.

### Features
The application interface is simple. The user needs to login first and also can create an account. And after logging in the user 
can upload the chest X-ray image to identify if it is affected by pneumonia or not. The user can also use test images from the 
app provided by us to check the working of the app. The user can know more about pneumonia from the toolbar and at last the user 
can logout themselves too.

### How to use?
We have uploaded the apk file in the main branch from where users can install this app on android only.
